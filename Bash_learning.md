# Bioinformatics notes

### RNA Types:
mRNA:    Messenger RNA, encodes proteins.  
tRNA:    Acts as adaptor between mRNA and amino acids. Transporter RNA, transports amino acids.  
rRNA:    Forms the ribosome.  
snRNA:   Functions in various nuclear processes. (example: splicing)  
snoRNA:  Facilitates the chemical modification of RNAs.    
miRNA:   Regulates gene expression.  
siRNA:   Silences gene expression.  
lncRNA:  Regulates gene expression.  

> New RNA type? Glyco-RNA  
Like Glycoprotein, Glycolipid etc., there are glycoRNAs 

## Discovery Analysis:

### mRNa Transcription unit:
> The DNA has a double helix structure.  
> Homework question: Does the cell use both strands or one single strand for mRNA transcription?

     #I just found out that I can add code here, nice.
     print("hello world")

- The mRNA is transcribed normally.
- If the mRNA contains useless regions with no protein coding.
- The mRNA goes through splicing to remove the introns.
- Mature mRNA codes proteins

> Another Homework question: The intronic slices of the mRNA gets thrown out of the sequence as the mRNA matures.   
> What happens to the intronic regions?

There are more proteins than there are genes in the cells.    
This is possible by alternative splicing[^1] of the mRNA. 

mRNA can...
- remove each intron,
- remove some exons as well as introns,
- remove part of exons,
- keep some introns,
- mutually exclude some exons etc.

Our goal is to determine transcriptional activities of every
single gene in the cell/tissue.
For this main steps are
1) Tissue collection,
2) Total RNA extraction and isolation,
3) cDNA preparation,
4) Quantification,
5) Comparative analysis 


QPCR (Quantitative PCR)
Transcriptome: 


[^1]: Splicing: is the mRNA maturation by cutting the introns out of the mRNA
