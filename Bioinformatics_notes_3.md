Identical genotypes but
various phenotypes / functions / features
Unique transcriptome profiles! —> Signatures
Transcriptome = Combination of all expressed genes


If you are intrested to do research on the single cell level there are multiple very large databases to research on.

Databases: 
- Human cell atlas (HCA) Project
- Genotype-tissue expression (GTEx)
- Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome (FANTOM)

**In a research shown in the Science booklet thing** 
- The transcriptome is heterpgeneous in even the same cells.
- Same cells with the exact same genetic background, same promoters, same gene regulation systems still produce and
express the same proteins a different amount.

> Individual cells express the genes in different ways.    
> Using the gene correlation matrix you can see which genes are possitively/negatively activated when other genes are active.   
> You can classify the cells to types by analysing the total gene expression in a group of cells.



### Single cell collection method: 
- Flow-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS)
  - Before using FACS you have to knwo the surface design of your cells
- Dilution
- Micromanipulation
- Laser capture microdissection
- Microfluidics
- Blood collection
  - Can take tumor cells that may be swimming in blood.
 
### inDrop-seq: droplet barcoding for sc transcription
When you mark the mRNA molecvule, you can count the expressed gene amont easier.
